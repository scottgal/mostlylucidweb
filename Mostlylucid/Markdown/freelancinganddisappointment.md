I've been a freelance developer for more than a decade now (since I left Microsoft really). For the most part it's been perfect for me. I love to work remotely; I'm deaf so offices aren't a great environment for me. 
What I don't like is the uncertainty of contracting. While it gives me the variety in coding / leading teams / mentoring that I love, it also means that I'm always looking for the next gig.

Being remote unfortunately also means you're easier to lay off; expecially for me who enjoys working form smaller companies it also means it's easier to ignore outstanding invoices. 

## Doesn't being self employed pay more?
Well yes, but that's for good reason; you really need 3-6 months buffer at any one time. Your income depends on the market for a very small number of roles (especially at my level) so you need to ensure you can survive a downturn.
You also need to stay on top of your taxes (seriously get an accountant) and outgoings. I've seen many come-a-cropper because they didn't keep an eye on their finances.

## Disappointment
I've been out of contract since the beginning of August this time, hence this blog existing. I NEED to work, it fills my day. In more recent years jobs have been harder to find. There was a swing to remote working during COVID but these have largely dried up now.
I had oone contract fall through for (frankly) baffling reasons I won't go into here in respect for the company.
Most of the time I'm 'too senior' to even bother interviewing for many roles. I'm not sure what to do about that. I'm not ready to retire yet and I'm not sure I ever will be.

# WFH
As I said previously, Work-From-Home is less a preference and more a requirement for me. I have a kick-ass setup here and I save a ton of time not travelling. 
I think much of the return-to-office drive is more due to ineffective managers and leaders being unable to navigate remote working. 

## Coders
I think as a group coders are almos tuniquely suited to remote working.
1. Our work is simple to track, check-in code that's been through a review; work done.
2. Coding is largely a solitary affair; in the office you wind up spending huge amounts of time just coding by yourself.
3. Often inspiration strikes outside of normal work hours. 

# What now?
So I JUST had a contract fall through. This happens (though for this reason never to me in 17 years). So now I'll keep working on this blog to save myself  going nuts.
