# Blog Update

<!--category-- Blog -->

This is just a quick post to update everyone on the status of this blog. I started it a little over a month ago and decided to commit to at least one post a day for the first month. 

So far I've posted 52 times in 30 days, so I met and exceeded this goal (yay me!). Now that I've 'kickstarted' the blog I plan to post less frequently but with more in-depth content.
Going forward I want to focus in on subjects like Unit Testing, ASP.NET architecture, OpenSearch and systems design and some (very Devvy) DevOps stuff.

Thanks for bearing with me thus far. I'm not delighted on the quality of posts I've achieved thus far (they're very code heavy and content light). I'm hoping to improve on this in the future.

Please feel free to comment below on what you'd like to see more of here. I'm always open to suggestions.

Thanks for reading in this first month! It's incredible that I've had over 1.5k visitors and 4.7k page views in this first month of a brand new experiment. I'm looking forward to the next month and beyond.
