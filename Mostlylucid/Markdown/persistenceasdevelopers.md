# The Virtue of Persistence As Developers

# Introduction
As I site here at 3am after spending the whole of last night sprucing up this blog it occurred to me that there's a key aspect of being a developer that many juniors don't yet understand.

**Being a great coder is less about talent and more about persistence.**

Much of the time you can rely on experience, enter 'the flow' and code like a machine. But there are times when you're stuck, when you're tired, when you're frustrated and when you're just not in the mood. It's at these times that persistence is key.

# The Importance of Persistence
Persistence is the ability to keep going when things get tough. It's the ability to keep pushing when you're tired, when you're frustrated and when you're just not in the mood. It's the ability to keep going when you're stuck, when you're lost and when you're not sure what to do next.  

Coding isn't always a walk in the park, sometimes stuff just doesn't work. I remember trying to grok ASP.NET WebForms for the first time. I read the book, wrote some code but stuff like ViewState and PostBacks just didn't make sense. 
I was living in Edinburgh at the time in a TINY flat above a garage, with my Tiny computer just grinding on understanding how it worked before I started a HUGE project at work using ASP.NET.

In those days we didn't have awesome blogs like this one to help us out. We had to rely on books; on talking to devs who had already been there done that (ASP.NET was super new at the time and Endinburgh was a bit of a backwater for tech).
